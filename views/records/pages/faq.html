    <h4 class="list-group-item-heading">Does a bank officer have to do any coding or additional technical setup to use the registry portal?</h4>
    <p class="list-group-item-text"><span style="font-style:italic;">No, a bank officer does not need to perform any coding or technical work to use the registry portal. The interface for making queries will function like any typical webpage. The only difference is that instead of fetching information from a server like a regular website, the registry portal will fetch data from a local database that is synced across the network using the blockchain.</span></p>

    <h4 class="list-group-item-heading">Does a bank have to add their customer records into the database?</h4>
    <p class="list-group-item-text"><span style="font-style:italic;">No, the banks do not have to add any customer records into the database. The only feature the banks can perform is querying records to retrieve data. </span></p>

<div class="list-group">
  <a class="list-group-item">
    <h4 class="list-group-item-heading">Is there any real customer data being used in the test?</h4>
    <p class="list-group-item-text"><span style="font-style:italic;">No, all the data in the test is dummy data generated by Elemential using a template provided by CERSAI and the NSE.</span></p>

<div class="list-group">
  <a class="list-group-item">
    <h4 class="list-group-item-heading">Since the database is distributed and auditable, does that mean every other bank will be able to see all my actions?</h4>
    <p class="list-group-item-text"><span style="font-style:italic;">Although the blockchain is a transparent, open, ledger that records every action, banks and FIs do not need to worry that all of their data and activity can be seen by other organizations. Each activity a bank performs will be recorded in the blockchain using an encrypted signature so that only trusted authorities like the NSE and CERSAI can see all the details of their activity. Additionally, each bank can see its own transaction history in full detail. </span></p>

<div class="list-group">
  <a class="list-group-item">
    <h4 class="list-group-item-heading">If my local blockchain node goes down, can I still access the database and make queries?</h4>
    <p class="list-group-item-text"><span style="font-style:italic;">Yes. If the local blockchain node goes down, banks will be able to use a different portal to make their queries. This portal will be hosted on a backup NSE server that is connected to the blockchain and can be accessed through a normal web browser. Banks will have unique IDs on this portal that they can use to query information if their local node goes down. After the node comes back up, they can switch back to the previous portal that connects to their local database.</span></p>

<div class="list-group">
  <a class="list-group-item">
    <h4 class="list-group-item-heading">If my local blockchain node goes down, how can I ensure that it is up to speed and reflects the latest data when it comes back online?</h4>
    <p class="list-group-item-text"><span style="font-style:italic;">The blockchain system and local database will automatically resynchronize with the rest of the network. As soon as the downed node is brought online, this resynchronization will take place, If a bank has made queries through the backup portal when its local node is down, these queries will still be logged and attributed to the bank so that they can be viewed on the bank nodeâ€™s transaction history page when the node is restored. </span></p>

<div class="list-group">
  <a class="list-group-item">
    <h4 class="list-group-item-heading">Will attackers or unauthorized people be able to communicate with my system or access the database?</h4>
    <p class="list-group-item-text"><span style="font-style:italic;">No, there will be a firewall installed in front of all servers so that only whitelisted and authorized IPs can communicate with the network and database.</span></p>
